Dev Log – Week of 9/29 -10/5
------------------------------------

🛠 What I worked on:
------------------------------
Got re-acclimated with our RC Learning Tool codebase and reviewed recent updates.

Continued implementing and testing Clerk webhook functionality for user management.

Researched best practices for working with webhooks in Vercel, focusing on deployment and local testing workflows.


💡Learnings:
-----------------------------
Gained a stronger understanding of Vercel’s authorization flow and how permissions work across different development environments.

Learned about Vercel Bearer Tokens and their role in enabling secure communication with third-party authorization providers.

⚠️Challenges:
--------------------------------
My biggest blocker this week was testing the Clerk webhooks — realizing that local and production behavior differs significantly. I’m currently working on streamlining the testing setup to better simulate production behavior for smoother debugging.
