💻 Projects Worked On 
------------------------------------------------
This week, I served again as PM for the Resilient AI Learning Tool. I spent time reviewing recent codebase changes and going through the research tickets assigned for this sprint. It was great to see that adding related engineers to specific tickets provided much more clarity on deliverables and expectations. Outside of that, I also spent time revamping my personal portfolio and updating it with some of my more recent projects.

📚 Learnings
------------------------------------------------
Working through NeetCode’s binary search problems helped me better understand the logic behind algorithmic formulas. I feel like I’m starting to grasp the reasoning behind each step rather than just memorizing patterns.

⏸️Challenges / Blockers
------------------------------------------------
I want to revisit some of the earlier NeetCode topics to gain that same deeper level of understanding that I now feel with binary search. Strengthening those foundations should help make the later problems feel more intuitive.
