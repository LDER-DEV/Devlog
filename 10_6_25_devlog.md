💻 Projects Worked On 
------------------------------------------------

This week, I stepped into a project management role for the RC Learning Tool. It was interesting approaching the project from a broader perspective—creating tickets, assessing priorities, and understanding where we stand in relation to our MVP. Looking through past sprints gave me a clearer sense of progress and what’s still missing before we can call it complete.
Outside of that, I also spent time rebuilding my personal profile using v0 and Cursor, experimenting with a concept inspired by flipping through a vinyl collection—except each record represents one of my projects.

📚 Learnings
------------------------------------------------
I learned a lot about what goes into making an efficient ticket—how clarity, scope, and impact all play into a team’s workflow. I also gained a better understanding of how to balance the “weight” of tasks, deciding which ones meaningfully push the project forward versus which can wait. The process helped me think more strategically about prioritization and long-term planning.

⏸️Challenges / Blockers
------------------------------------------------

No major blockers this week, but shifting into a PM mindset was definitely an adjustment. It required zooming out from code-level thinking to big-picture coordination, which was both new and challenging. I’m still learning how to balance creative input with structured management work.
