Weekly Devlog 9.15-9.21

üíª Projects Worked On 

Pinterest Clone ‚Äì Continued progress on building out core functionality.

EchoTutor ‚Äì A spaced repetition learning app that uses AI for question generation. This week I worked on deployment with Vercel, refining the product requirements, and experimenting with frontend scaffolding.
------------------------------------------------
üîë Key Accomplishments

Began using MCPs within Cursor to streamline development workflows. The Vercel MCP was especially helpful in deploying EchoTutor with less manual setup.

Drafted and refined a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for EchoTutor. This helped me set a clear direction for the project, and I found the process to be a game changer in reducing tension during development.

Leveraged v0 for initial frontend creation, which sped up prototyping and gave me a strong foundation to iterate on.

Completed NeetCode challenges 1‚Äì5 on arrays. This gave me hands-on practice with array data structures, and while I felt comfortable with most solutions, I identified optimization concepts I need to revisit.
------------------------------------------------
üìö Learnings

AI tools are highly effective but only when given the right specificity and context. I also learned that providing too much context can negatively affect prompt efficiency.

The PRD process reinforced the value of planning ahead‚Äîhaving foresight made development smoother and gave me confidence in decision-making.

My struggles with TailwindCSS highlighted the importance of fully understanding the tools I‚Äôm using. Styling still feels unintuitive, and dependency/version mismatches slowed me down.

I ran into issues with PDF text extraction for EchoTutor. Converting extracted text into structured questions for flashcards is proving to be more complex than expected.
------------------------------------------------
‚è∏Ô∏èChallenges / Blockers

TailwindCSS: Still getting used to the styling system and running into dependency/version conflicts.

AI-assisted code generation: Some technologies suggested by AI lacked the context I needed, leading to implementation issues.

PDF processing: Finding reliable ways to extract text and feed it into the AI question-generation pipeline.
------------------------------------------------
‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

Research alternative approaches to uploading and parsing documents (like PDFs) for EchoTutor.

Spend focused time studying TailwindCSS fundamentals, with the goal of reducing blockers in future sprints.

Continue with NeetCode challenges, with an emphasis on learning and applying optimization techniques.
